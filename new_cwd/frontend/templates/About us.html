                    With thousands of movies released every year, finding the right one to watch can be overwhelming. We wanted to simplify this process by creating a smart and efficient recommendation tool that helps users discover movies they will enjoy without wasting time. This project was developed as part of our academic coursework at BMS College of Engineering (BMSCE), combining our interest in films with our passion for technology and problem-solving.
